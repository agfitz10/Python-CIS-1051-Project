# Python-CIS-1051-Project

I wasn't sure if this was required or not but I'll share more in depth what I have learned:

- How to create pixilized characters in Photoshop
- How to utilize GB Studio
- That coding takes time, but I love the whole design process of it from the art making to figuring out how to design code in a whole new way.

I did research on how to create characters, scenes, scripts, and GB Studio in general from Youtube videos.

Difficulties:

- Bugs in code: I had to restart some of the process because it is out of my wheelhouse to debug a software program
- When I first started coding, the wire game was a mess, it would not rotate when I wanted it to.

Solution came from trial and error.

The major obstacle in this was time, due to my chaotic schedule, the ideal game was not achievable but I am proud of the fact that I can see it -- made something from nothing.
