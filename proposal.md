# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

ProjectX: Escaping the Floating Metal Box in Space

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An escape room game based on a spaceship.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

GB Studio will be utilized for this project. A sprite character will be controlled by the user to walk through the room to escape. Character movement and actions will be executed through keyboard commands/input. When an object is clicked on, the user can inspect it and look for clues. Some objects will have puzzles to complete that will aid in solving the escape. A baseline of three puzzles need to be solved to get to a final puzzle which will open the door.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will complete coding and implementing at least one puzzle for the game along with having a basic background and object art, and music.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will have 2-3 puzzles coded and done. When clicked on, objects will be movable rather than still. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having all 4 puzzles completed, no issues with the code, and smooth operations with character movement and outcomes.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will read up on how to use the GB Studio software and learn how to import music and digital art into it. I am planning on creating some objects within photoshop and importing them as pngs. I will have to do research on what types of puzzles I want to utilize and the framework of their code. I will record music I play from my guitar and master it, I know how to use adobe audition for this process, and then upload it into GB Studio.
